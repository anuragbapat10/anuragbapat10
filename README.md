### About Me

I'm a Computer Science grad student at the **University of Southern California** (MS, 2026), with a background in backend engineering, distributed systems, and ML. Before USC, I spent a year at **Interactive Brokers** as a Software Engineer, building ETL systems, database pipelines, and stream-processing infrastructure in Java and PL/SQL.

I'm drawn to work that rewards going deeper - whether that's in backend systems, low-level kernels, infrastructure or applied ML - and understanding why something behaves the way it does rather than just accepting that it does.

### 🔨 Featured Projects

**Weenix - Unix-like OS Kernel**
> Built in C. Covers process management, virtual filesystem (VFS) and virtual memory (VM) with 15+ syscalls, demand paging, copy-on-write fork via shadow objects, and memory-mapped file support. Debugged kernel concurrency issues and page faults with GDB.

**Cloud-Based Emotion Recognition Pipeline**
> Serverless, event-driven pipeline on AWS. Python Lambda + Rekognition performs sentiment analysis across 8 facial emotions from classroom snapshots. Express.js handles base64 image ingestion to S3.

**Issue Reporting System**
> Full-stack issue tracker (Laravel + Django) with microservices architecture, hierarchical commenting, and an automated ML tagging pipeline (89% validation accuracy). Research published in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10136114).

**Named Entity Recognition - BiLSTM & BiLSTM-CRF**
> PyTorch implementation of BiLSTM and BiLSTM-CRF on CoNLL-2003. The CRF layer improved F1 from 0.820 to **0.838**, matching the benchmark - by incorporating label dependencies for sequence labeling.
